A valid One Call ticket was in hand, and the location had been properly flagged. Two anchors were installed without incident. While setting the third anchor, the employee struck a steel line approximately six inches below ground surface.\n\nUpon contact, the line ruptured and released a large volume of air. No water or oil was observed. The employee immediately shut down operations and vacated the area. The incident was promptly reported to management and Permian personnel.\n\nThe employee was instructed to move his truck out of the area if it could be done safely. He was able to relocate the vehicle without issue. Permian personnel arrived on location and identified the damaged line as a compressed air line. They isolated and closed the line, eliminating the release.\n\nPermian then contacted their line locate group to fully locate the line. Our truck will remain released from the area until the line has been completely located and the job is cleared to resume",

The crew hooked up to the flush mount and lifted with the hoist when a Cameron Surface System torque key installed on the landing joint disengaged and struck a crew member on the right shoulder. No injury occurred and no medical treatment was required.\n\nEquipment Involved:\nThird party Cameron Surface\nSystems Torque key installed as part of the landing joint configuration\n\nImmediate Cause:\nDisengagement of third-party Cameron Surface Systems torque key during hoist activity. \n\nContributing Factors:\nUse of Cameron Surface Systems torque key that was later reviewed by Cameron Surface Systems operations and determined to be unnecessary for Cameron landing joint operations and deemed overkill for the application. \n\nCorrective actions (completed):\n- Cameron Surface systems remove torque keys from all Oxy drilling rig operations.\n- Cameron technicians instructed to communicate with drillers to avoid applying rotational torque during CRT installation. \n- Cameron assigned account oversight to ensure torque keys are not used on Oxy locations moving forward.\n- BRHAS crews reminded to verify equipment configuration prior to hoisting activities and to maintain clear lift-area awareness.\n",

When the tongs were engaged, the stored torque caused the tongs to spin, and the bails caught on the tong hoist, lifting the tongs approximately 10\u201315 feet. Operations were stopped immediately, and no injuries were reported. The driller later stated that torque had not been released prior to the crew placing tongs on the joint. Damage to the tong spring was observed, and further inspection of the equipment will be conducted to determine if additional damage occurred.",

After turning left onto Talley Rd, a third-party vehicle came over a hill at a high rate of speed and struck Unit 2341 along the driver\u2019s side. The impact pushed Unit 2341 several feet, where it ultimately came to rest against a cement wall.\n\nThe other vehicle bounced off Unit 2341, crossed back over to its lane, and continued approximately 124 feet down the bar ditch before coming to a stop. Mr. Makupson reported no injuries at the scene and confirmed the following morning that he was still uninjured. The other driver was transported by ambulance to a local hospital for evaluation. According to law enforcement, the driver was expected to be okay.\n\nBoth vehicles were towed from the scene. Unit 2341 was later moved to Butch\u2019s Yard in Pleasanton and will eventually be relocated to the Midland Yard.\n\nAt the time of this report, no citations have been issued to Mr. Makupson. Safety is awaiting completion of the official crash report so that third-party information can be collected and added to this report.",

The damage appears to be minor and primarily cosmetic.\n\nPost-Incident Actions:\n\nSafety department contacted the third party. They will obtain a repair estimate and follow up once available.\n\nThe employee completed post-accident drug and alcohol testing.\n\nThe employee will be referred for Smith Systems driver re-education.\n\nThird-Party Information:\nCompany: Panhandle Express LLC\nAddress: 133 W.

Crew members Tyler Fitzwillam, Aaron Romero, Acosta, and two Patterson hands were preparing to hoist the power tongs to the rig floor and held a tailgate safety briefing beforehand, where a Patterson hand instructed everyone to stay clear of the off-side where the hoist is located due to the tendency of the tongs to swing that direction once they clear the floor. As the tongs came through the V-door, they began to swing toward drill pipe on the hoist side, and Acosta attempted to steer the tongs away, placing himself in the line of fire and catching his right knee between the tongs and the pipe. Acosta walked down the stairs unassisted and was helped to a truck tailgate, then transported for medical evaluation where x-rays showed no fractures, and he was released to full duty with the case remaining first aid only.\n\n",

Reduced visibility due to dusk/nighttime conditions and limited lighting in the work area.\n\n3. Employee was positioned in the line of fire while manually holding the poly line during positioning.",
      "Recommended Corrective Actions": "1. Require a second crew member to assist in controlling and securing the poly line in the clamp during positioning and welding.\n2. Ensure adequate lighting is in place for evening or low-light operations before work begins.\n3. Reinforce line-of-fire awareness and safe body positioning when handling or staging poly line.\n4. Conduct a safety standdown for poly crews following weather events to review footing hazards, lighting conditions, line-of-fire exposure, and controls before resuming work.\n5. Management to evaluate the use of a long-roller or similar mechanical straightening device to help control poly line during cold weather conditions when the material tends to curl, reducing the need for employees to manually hold the line in place.",

The crew spent roughly 1.5\u20132 hours troubleshooting before the tool finally released. A replacement CRTe was sent to location, and the affected tool was brought back to the shop for teardown.",
      "2. Immediate Mode of Failure:": "Tool would not latch onto the J-hooks and complete the release. Rotation was present, but the tool stayed locked to the casing.",
      "3. Initial Field Observations:": "- Tool stayed engaged on casing even with multiple release attempts.\n\n- Air was bled off; no immediate change.\n\n- One housing bolt was removed to check for trapped air.\n\n- Torque and RPM were increased to 15,000 ft-lbs and 15 RPM.\n\n- After sitting and multiple attempts, the tool finally released.\n\n- When it disengaged, a small amount of trapped air escaped.",
      "4. R&M Inspection Findings:": "* Complete teardown showed no internal damage.\n\n* J-hooks, latch components, mandrel, and internal hardware were all intact.\n\n* No abnormal wear or mechanical failure found.\n\n* Tool was reassembled and passed function tests.",
      "5. Contributing Factors": "-Trapped air/pressure inside the casing pushing against the tool.\n\n- Unknown whether the 2\u201d valve was opened to relieve pressure.\n\n- Pressure prevented the latch mechanism from lining up with the J-hooks.\n\n- Sitting on the casing allowed the pressure to slowly bleed off.\n\n- Increased torque/RPM helped overcome resistance from pressure.",
      "6. Root Cause": "The issue was caused by trapped pressure inside the casing, which prevented the CRTe from lining up and latching onto the J-hooks during the release. There were no mechanical issues with the tool itself.",

Corrective Actions:": "* Tool was swapped out on location.\n\n* Full teardown completed; tool cleared and returned to service.\n\n* Reinforced reminder to open the 2\u201d valve to bleed trapped air before attempting tool release.\n\n* Passed along guidance to crews on how trapped pressure can affect disengagement.",
